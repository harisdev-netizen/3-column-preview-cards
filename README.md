### What I learned

I am particularly proud of how I implemented the styles for the cards in this project. I used Flexbox to ensure that the layout is responsive and works well on different screen sizes. I also customized the hover effects for the buttons to create a smooth transition effect. Here's a snippet of the code I am proud of:

For example:

```css
.card a:hover {
  background: transparent;
  transition: background-color 0.3s;
  color: #f2f2f2;
  border: 1px solid #ddd;
}

.sedan {
  background-color: #E28625;
  border-radius: 8px 0 0 8px;
}

.suv {
  background-color: #006971;
  border-radius: 0 5px 5px 0;
}

.luxury {
  background-color: #00494d;
  border-radius: 0 8px 8px 0;
}
```

The above code snippet demonstrates how I styled each card with different background colors and applied rounded corners based on their positions. I also used transitions to enhance the interactivity of the button elements.
